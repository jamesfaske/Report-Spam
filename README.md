Report-Spam
===========

This is a VTSO addin for outlook that will send the selected email to the address of your choice. It will then delete the email after sending. 

The email address will default to an arbitrary address but can, and should, be changed by navigating to C:\ReportSpamOfficeAddIn\settings.ini
